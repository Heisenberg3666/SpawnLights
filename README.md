SpawnLights is a plugin for the game SCP: SL using the Exiled framework.
When a spawn wave is spawned, the surface of the facility's lights are coloured blue or green (the colour depends on which team spawns).

```yaml
spawn_lights:
  is_enabled: true
  # The time (seconds) that the lights will stay a colour.
  time_enabled: 15
```
